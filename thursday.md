# Day 4

## Learning objectives
By the end of today, you will
- finish your first project in Python
- be able to use some modules in Python to do some math, plotting, and data manipulation.
- learn about how to look at the data from an air quality sensor.

## Agenda

- First, let's start with checking in.
  - What has been the muddiest points so far?
- Then take some time to finish the projects. Today we have some more hints so that you can finish your projects.
- Then we will talk about how to use _modules_ in Python with some examples
- After a quick break, we will look into an actual air quality sensor, possibly walk around a block to measure air quality.
- We will look into the data that the sensor generates and show how to plot them.
- Finally, we will talk about the final project for Friday.

## Few things before we start
This file and the README file and many other files in this repository will be written using _markdown_. You can think markdown as a simple text-based tool to organize thoughts!

It is recommended that you try using markdown yourself, too. At least for this program. And see if you like it.

To get you started, [here's a cheatsheet on Markdown (md)](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet)
