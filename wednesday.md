# Day 3

## Learning objectives
By the end of today, you will
- get more more practice on with _conditional statements_ and _loops_.
- be able to write simple _functions_.
- write a _Python_ code for a group project.

## Agenda
Today we will delve deeper into Python coding and do a group project.

- First, let's start with checking in.
  - What has been the muddiest points so far?
- Then we will do some revision of _lists_ and _loops_
- We will talk about _functions_
- Finally for the last one hour you will work on a group project.

#

Note: The algorithms that we will give you for your projects are very inefficient, but they are straightforward as they kind of follow how we would approach the problem in our head. Later, you can play with the code to create more efficient versions of the project.



## Few things before we start
This file and the README file and many other files in this repository will be written using _markdown_. You can think markdown as a simple text-based tool to organize thoughts!

It is recommended that you try using markdown yourself, too. At least for this program. And see if you like it.

To get you started, [here's a cheatsheet on Markdown (md)](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet)
