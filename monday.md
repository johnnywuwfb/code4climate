## Few things before we start
This file and the README file and many other files in this repository will be written using _markdown_. You can think markdown as a simple text-based tool to organize thoughts!

It is recommended that you try using markdown yourself, too. At least for this program. And see if you like it.

To get you started, [here's a cheatsheet on Markdown (md)](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet)
