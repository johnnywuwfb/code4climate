# Day 2

## Learning objectives
By the end of today, you will
- get familiar with _data types_, _variables, and conversion of _data types_. 
- learn how to use _conditional statements_ and _loops_.
- be able to write simple _functions_.
- read and understand _Python_ codes.
- write a simple _Python_ code using conditionals and loops and functions.

## Agenda
Today we will delve deeper into Python coding and learn its grammar and vocabulary.

- First, let's start with checking in.
  - Were you able to install Python or Anaconda in your home machine?
  - Did you try and explore _github_ or _markdown notes_
  - Did you try to write some more _Python_ codes on your own? Did they work? Did they not work?
  - Did you post in the forum?
  - Did you participate in the [poll](https://github.com/orgs/c4c-2023/discussions/2#discussion-5436146)?
- Here's the plan for today
  - Do you have Google account?
    - Yes: We will use Google Colab instead of github Codespace for this program
	- No: Were you able to install Anaconda/Python in your laptop?
      - Yes: Let's use your laptop
	  - No: Please borrow a laptop from the cart.
- We will parctice on various types of variables, some conditional statements, loops, and functions together

Note: The decision process of whether to use Google or laptop is a conditional assessment. In [pseudocode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudocode) terms:

    IF you have Google account
      Use Google Colab to run remotely
    ELIF your laptop has Ananconda installed
      Use your laptop to run locally  
    ELSE
      Borrow a laptop from the cart


## Few things before we start
This file and the README file and many other files in this repository will be written using _markdown_. You can think markdown as a simple text-based tool to organize thoughts!

It is recommended that you try using markdown yourself, too. At least for this program. And see if you like it.

To get you started, [here's a cheatsheet on Markdown (md)](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet)
